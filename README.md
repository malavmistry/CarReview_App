Made a project on, “Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining of Online Product Reviews”.
Created a responsive and user friendly web site.
Used web crawler to scan reviews and fetch them from a website, named www.zigwheels.com. 
Performed natural language processing on these reviews. 
With the POS tagging, all the nouns (the product feature) and adjectives (good or bad points) were fed as input to SentiWordnet, 
which sets the polarity to each feature, positive or negative.
Using the average of these polarities an overview of the product is given in the form of a table. 
The technology used are Visual Studio, C#, SQL Server, web crawler, HTML, XML, JavaScript, jQuery, SentiWordNet, 
POS tagging, Natural Language Processing (NLP).
